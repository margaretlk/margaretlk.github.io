            <h2>berlin projects.</h2>
            <p>both of these you can find on my youtube, but i decided to put them again in my portfolio because i'm so proud. my time in berlin was really special, i made so many connections during my time there & lifelong friends.
                i spent a breif period in berlin, just from sept 2024 - early nov 2024, but i took fascinating classes on radio production & gender and media. i had never been to germany, so it was a very exciting time, but also an internal time of self reflection for me. </p>

            <h3 >possibly in berlin. (2024)</h3>
            <p>this film was a collaborative effort between me and maxx goodman & kaitlyn tran. 
            <br> an abstract exploration of transportation to and from a night out, but our main character is being followed.

            <h3> stardust memories (2024)</h3>
            <p>my theme of abroad was self exploration and this piece followed the idea that people leave holes in our memories. </p>
